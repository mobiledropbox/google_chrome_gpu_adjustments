# google_chrome_gpu_adjustments
This repository is intended to help you making adjustments with Google Chrome gpu features.
# English well-mannered version
Nothing is special with this repository, no script required to execute. All you need to do is to access GPU Internals and Experiments page of Google chrome.
You can access the **GPU Internals** using the address bar:
```
chrome://gpu
```
Same thing with **Experiments:**
```
chrome://flags
```
The GPU Internals page will provide you the overview about the disabled features you wish to enable while the Experiments page will give you the context of its purpose together with the option of enabling the feature.
# Taglish tolonges gedli etneb version
